# PIMD Simulation for 1D QHO

Implementation of PIMD for a one-dimensional argon particle in a QHO potential with $\hbar \omega_0 = 50 \~ \mathrm{meV}$.

## Configuring the script

* `params.py` contains system parameters such as the frequency of the oscillator, its mass and the friction term of the Langevin thermostat

## Energy vs beta

For the default (primitive) energy estimator:
